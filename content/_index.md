# Andrew Grapentin

LPC

In Practice for 7 Years, currently in the Swartz Creek / Lapeer region.

As your therapist, my goal is to offer you a dedicated place to navigate lifeâ€™s challenges and to offer you tools that will help you foster long-term growth and change. Whether those challenges include anxiety, depression, PTSD, LGBTQ, or grief, I want to work with you to increase your quality of life.
