# Andrew Grapentin

<span class="credentials">LPC, CDBT</span>

As your therapist, my goal is to offer you a dedicated place to navigate life’s challenges and to offer you tools that will help you foster long-term growth and change. Whether those challenges include anxiety, depression, PTSD, LGBTQ, or grief, I want to work with you to increase your quality of life.

I utilize an integrative approach with a focus on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI). I generally adhere to a Solution-focused approach to therapy where I wish to create an environment conducive in developing customized and achievable goals that work with your strengths and areas of concern. Through these approaches, I aim to guide and support you in reaching your goals.

In addition, I am certified in Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Complex Trauma as a Level 2 practitioner.

Over the years I have worked with a diverse clientele including children, adolescents, adults, and couples. I am passionate about using a culturally sensitive and trauma informed lens to honor your unique background and experiences. My plan is to meet you where you’re at and help you get to where you want to be.
